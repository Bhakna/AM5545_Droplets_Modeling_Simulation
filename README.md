# AM5545 Droplets Modeling and Simulation
This is the 4th assignment for the course AM5545 (Introduction to Multiphase Flows). The solution is given as a collection of MATLAB files which simulate the entire process of binary collision of droplets.

# Initializing Parameters
To check the default parameters used in this simulation (or to change them), please go to the "simulateDroplets.m" file.

# Running the model
To run the model and plot real-time droplet collisions, type and enter the following line in the command line / terminal of the MATLAB software : "run simulateDroplets.m".

# To be noted
It is to be noted that the general ideas and emperical equations used in the modeling of this process were established by the author (which is me), whereas, the code itself was written (and then re-written multiple times) and debugged using ChatGPT. So please, if you have any doubts in the code, or if there any bugs you found, kindly refer to ChatGPT and NOT THE AUTHOR.
